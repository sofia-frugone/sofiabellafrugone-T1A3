Develop a list of features that will be included in the application:
Feature 1: View how to make a coffee
The user can select a coffee from 5 different options. Once it's been selected the program will output what the steps for making the coffee are. 
A coffee class was created and initialised the coffee and steps. I used to_s to print the users selection. I also used to_i when taking the users input.
I used a loop to print the statements for all the coffees. 

Feature 2 and 3: View coffee shots and View coffee price
Feature 2 and 3 were implemeted in a very similar way. I created an array for each size and used .each method to iterate over the array.
